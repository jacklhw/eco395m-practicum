I am Hanwen Liu, a student in Master of Economics program at the University of Texas at Austin. I have gained a solid foundation in economic theory, quantitative analysis, and research methodologies. Through coursework and independent study, I have developed a deep understanding of various economic models, statistical techniques, and data analysis tools such as R, Stata, and python. My academic training has equipped me with the necessary skills to contribute effectively to research activities and provide valuable insights. 

Since this summer, I have been working as a research assistant at Ball State University, where I have been studying with Professor Tung Liu and gaining practical experience in economics research.
