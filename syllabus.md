# Course Description and Requirements

## Course Description

The Data Science Practicum offers a practical immersion into the realm of data science through engagement in real-world projects provided by industry partners.  
Collaborating in teams, you will undertake substantial data-driven initiatives with established organizations, enriching your understanding of techniques such as data analysis, predictive modeling, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making.  

Throughout the course, students will engage in weekly team update meetings, known as "standups," which will occur during class time. During these standups, students will meet with their teams and the instructor to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
In addition to standups, students will also have less frequent touchpoint meetings with industry partners and myself. These meetings may or may not occur during class time. These interactions provide valuable opportunities for guidance, feedback, and alignment with the project's goals.  

This course is rooted in experiential learning, emphasizing a hands-on approach to mastering the intricacies of data science practice.

## Course Objectives

The Data Science Practicum, much like an internship, provides students a valuable opportunity to apply their data science knowledge to real-world contexts, mirroring the experience of addressing practical challenges akin to those encountered in a professional environment.  
Although important parts of the learning process take place during scheduled class time standups and meetings, the majority of the coursework and learning occurs beyond the classroom setting. This includes engagement in team discussions, interactions, and consultations with the instructor and industry partners.  

The course aims to assist students in achieving the following objectives:

* Acquire advanced insights into data science by applying theoretical concepts to real-world situations.
* Develop proficiency in the role of a data science consultant, gaining firsthand experience in collaborative problem-solving within a team to address data-related challenges.
* Create relevant data science-related accomplishments that you can add to your resumes and discuss in interviews.
* Enhance portfolios with hands-on experience and practical projects showcasing data science expertise.
* Foster the development of insights and networking connections that can have a positive impact on one's professional journey.


## Course Policies

### Confidentiality

Depending on the partner company that students are assigned to, they may or may not, need to enter into a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with the partner company.  

If you are assigned to a partner company that requires an NDA, you must enter into it by the end of the first week of class.
Failure to do so will make it impossible to complete your assigned project and you will receive a grade of F for the class if you continue to be enrolled.  

However, _all_ information provided by a partner company is to be treated as confidential and used only for project-related purposes.
Treat your partner company’s data, strategy, and conversations as confidential.
Do not reveal any information without express permission from your partner company.

In the unlikely event that a breach of confidentiality occurs, it may impact your course grade at the discretion of the instructor with input from the partner company.

### Team Expectations

In addition to the requirements of the course, your team should set expectations with its members.

Some examples include:
* Responding to correspondence from team members within 24 hours
* Updating members when tasks are completed or stalled on Discord and/or GitHub, etc.
* Joining or arriving at internal team meetings within 5 minutes of the agreed start times.
* Posting progress, or lack thereof, daily or on alternate days to Discord.

A part of your grade will be accessed by your team members in weekly peer reviews, so it is important to meet their expectations.

### Attendance and Standup

Each week your team will have a 30-minute standup with me during class time. The timing and day of the standup may fluctuate based on constraints such as meeting with industry partners.  
You are expected to attend every class standup for your team, however, you will be allotted 1 absence from standup without the need to explain it. However, you should notify your team and your instructor.
Unless a prior agreement is made with both the team and your instructor, any further absences from standup will result in a loss of 10% of your final course grade each.

### Grading

Grades will be based on:
* Midterm Deliverable/Presentation (20%)
* Final Deliverable/Presentation (40%)
* Weekly Standup -- Group Component (20%)
* Weekly Standup -- Individual Peer-graded Component (20%)

Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric.  

Please note: to ensure fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus a B- will be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999.  A = 94-100 A- = 90-93 B+ = 87-89 B = 84-86 B- = 80-83 C+ = 77-79 C = 74-76 C- = 70-73 D+ = 67-69 D = 64-66 D- = 60-63 F = 0-60.  

Grades will be _not_ be curved. Please do not ask me about extra credit or extra work to improve your grade. None will be given.

### Deliverables and Presentations

Different projects from different industry partners will have different goals and deliverables so cannot be evaluated on a common rubric.
Grades will be assigned based on my discretion with feedback from industry partners.  

Some examples of evaluation criteria I find important see these project rubrics from my other course:
* https://github.com/edkrueger/eco395m/blob/main/projects/midterm-project.md
* https://github.com/edkrueger/eco395m/blob/main/projects/final-project.md

Industry partners may also include some evaluation criteria relating to particular projects.

### Weekly Standup -- Group Component

After every standup, the instructor will evaluate your group's progress based on the following criteria and scale.

Criteria:
* Communication
* Accountability
* Quantity of Contributions
* Quality of Contributions

Scale:
* Unsatisfactory (1 point)
* Needs Improvement (2 points)
* Satisfactory (3 points)
* Good (4 points)
* Excellent (5 points)

Therefore you will receive up to 20 points per standup and the results will be averaged across the standups you attend for up to 20% of your course grade.

### Weekly Standup -- Individual Peer-graded Component

At the end of standup, you'll anonymously evaluate every member of your group on the following criteria based on the previous week assigning a score based on a 5-point scale.

Criteria:
* Communication
* Accountability
* Quantity of Contributions
* Quality of Contributions

Scale:
* Unsatisfactory (1 point)
* Needs Improvement (2 points)
* Satisfactory (3 points)
* Good (4 points)
* Excellent (5 points)

Therefore you will receive up to 20 points per standup and the results will be averaged across the standups you attend for up to 20% of your course grade.
